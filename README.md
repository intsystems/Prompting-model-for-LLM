## Abstract
In recent years, the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created vast potential for automating and enhancing natural language processing tasks, including content generation and editing. This article proposes a framework for developing a model specifically tailored for generating and refining edit prompts for LLMs. The goal is to improve the quality, precision, and coherence of output based on user modifications, thereby enhancing the interactive capabilities of LLMs in creative and professional settings. Methods for creating a universal prompta/universal batch of prompta for a different set of LLMs are proposed.
